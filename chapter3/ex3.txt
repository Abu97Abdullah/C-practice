3.
(a)
Equivalent.

(b)
Not equivalent. For example, "%d-%d-%d" will not fully match with "5•-5-5", leaving "•-5-5" for the next scanf. But "%d -%d -%d" will be able to scan all of it.

(c)
Not equivalent. "%f " will keep consuming whitespace characters until it encounters a non-whitespace character. Then it will put back that non-whitespace character for the next scanf.

(d)
Equivalent.
